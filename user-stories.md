Developing an app called 'Save Me a Seat' that allows users to search by their favorite recording artists names to see where and when they will be performing next.

-- AS A USER --

As a user, I want to open this app to a homepage and see a search bar and a logo/visual of the app.

As a user, I want to be able to type in the artist's name and submit that information with a button.

As a user, I want to be shown a profile/selection of the artist I searched for.

As a user, on the page of the artist I searched for, I want to see the next 10 events from the date I made the search.

As a user, I want to be able to save a specific event and the information that accompanies that event.

-- AS THE DEVELOPER

As the developer, I want to build a homepage which gives the user a visual of our logo/name along with a search field.

As the developer, I want to build a search field for the user to type in an artist in order to see when they perform next.

As the developer, I want to build in API search functionality in order to return information back to the user regarding time, date, and location of the event.

As the developer, I want to present an image of the artist using the API results to confirm to the user that they are looking for events according to their search.

As the developer, I want to return up to 10 events back to the users after they have searched for the artist of their choice.

As the developer, I want to build a database named 'Saved Seats' which will be used to store the saved events the user wishes to get tickets for.

As the developer, I want to build a 'Want us to save you a seat?' button for users to click in order to save the event to their 'Saved Seats' database.

As the developer, I want to provide a link that navigates users to where they can buy tickets for their saved events but only once they've saved it to their 'Saved Seats' database.

As the developer, I want an engaging UI that visually attracts users to want to engage with our app and use it simply.
